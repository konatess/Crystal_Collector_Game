# Crystal_Collector_Game
jQuery Homework for UW Coding Bootcamp

The assignment is to create a game that generates a random number, and by clicking on four icons with hidden random numbers, the player attempts to get to the exact number that was generated at the start of the game. 

I decided to use bugs for my theme. Here's a screenshot of the game in action.
